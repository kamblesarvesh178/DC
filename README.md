# Distributed Computing (DC)

This repository contains code and resources related to the **Distributed Computing** course/project for the **Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** branch. It includes implementations and examples of key distributed computing concepts such as **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**, **Remote Method Invocation (RMI)**, and **Load Balancing**.

## 📁 Repository Structure

├── 3load.txt      # Load balancing implementation
```

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Java** – All implementations are written in Java.
- **Distributed Systems Concepts** – RPC, RMI, Load Balancing.

## 📌 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kamblesarvesh178/DC.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the `.txt` files to explore the code and logic.
3. Compile and run the Java files using your preferred build tool (e.g., Gradle, Ant, or manually via `javac`).

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)** – Simulates calling procedures on remote systems.
- **RMI (Remote Method Invocation)** – Java-based remote method execution.
- **Load Balancing** – Distributes workload across multiple systems.

## 📦 Future Enhancements

- Add GUI for visualizing distributed processes.
- Include Docker setup for simulating distributed environments.
- Add more examples like distributed file systems or message queues.
